# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

# Overview 

The purpose of this project was to analyze different data aspects related to the employees that are likely to retire in the next few years from Pewlett Hackard and to see what the company will need to be prepared to fill. Specifically, we were asked to: 

1) determine the number of retiring employees per title
2) identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program

# Program 
* pgAdmin (SQL) and Microsoft Excel 

# Results 

Based on the analysis we perfomed, we compiled the following [counts by title](https://github.com/Stewartsl17/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/master/Data/retiring_titles.csv) of who will be eligible for retirement:

* 29,414 Senior Engineers
* 28,254 senior staff
* 14,222 Engineers
* 12,243 staff
* 4502 technique leaders
* 1761 Assistant Engineers
* 2 Managers 

Furthermore, based on the directive to see who would be [eligible](https://github.com/Stewartsl17/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/master/Data/mentorship_eligibility.csv) for joining a mentoring program, we found that 1,549 employees that are the verge of retiring fit the criteria for the program.

# Summary

Based on the analysis we performed, there are some concerns and potential additional queries that we could do to provide more information. One concern is that there is a incredibly large amount of retirement-eligible employees that are senior members (Engineers and Staff), which amounts to 64%.
